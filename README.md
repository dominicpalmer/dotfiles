Welcome. This is my personal config. It is updated in somewhat regular intervals.

Alongside configuration, this repo is home to anything I deem moderately useful enough to be easily accessible on new machines. That includes notes and template files applicable to installation and use of software, system settings for Unix and Windows environments, plus custom keyboard layouts and extension layer implementations.
