# dotfiles

Welcome. This is my personal configuration.

This repo is home to anything I deem moderately useful enough to be easily accessible on new machines. That includes dotfiles for Alacritty, Tmux, Zsh, Neovim, VSCode and Firefox, plus a couple of my favorite fonts. To install:

```bash
cd && git clone https://github.com/dominicpalmer/dotfiles.git && ./install.sh
```
